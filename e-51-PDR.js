/*
By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out the six of the nine possible values: 13,23,43,53,73,and 83, are all primes.

By replacig the 3rd and 4th digit of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having same primes among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. consicutively 56003, being the first memeber of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.

Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eigth prime value family.
